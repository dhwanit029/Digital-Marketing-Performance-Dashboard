Overview
A unified performance dashboard that transforms 4 hours of manual reporting work into just 4 minutes. This solution centralizes Google Ads and Meta Ads data into a single Power BI dashboard, eliminating the tedious cycle of downloading CSVs, manual data entry, and spreadsheet formatting.
The Problem
Digital marketing teams waste 15-20 hours every month on manual reporting:

Logging into multiple platforms (Google Ads, Meta Ads Manager)
Downloading countless CSV files
Opening Excel and manually consolidating data
Copying, pasting, and formatting metrics
Dealing with version control and human errors
Repeating this process weekly or monthly

Marketers should be analyzing campaigns, not wrestling with CSVs.
